# Data Structures

##Big-O Notation
We use **Big-O** notation to describe the performance of an algorithm
Measure the runtime complexity of an operation

### Linear Structures
* Arrays
* Linked List
* Stacks (LIFO, Pilas)
* Queues (FIFO, colas)
* Hash Tables

#### Arrays
Arrays in C# are static, it means has a fixed size
index starts with 0

####Linked List
We use Linked List to store a list of objects in sequence
but unlinke arrays, linked list can shrink and grow authomatically.
